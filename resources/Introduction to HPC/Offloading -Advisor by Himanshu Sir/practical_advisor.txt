// Practical
Below is the sample command to run an application with intel offload advisor: advisor --collect=offload --config=gen12_tgl --project-dir=./mmul_report -- ./mmult_serial

Write a SHELL SCRIPT to run any executable file with intel offload advisor. The shell script should:
- load the required modules for running advisor (ask the user the name of the advisor module and load it using module load command)
- ask the user for config option (gpu name)
- ask the user for the absolute path to the executable file
- ask the user for the absolute path to the project directory (it can be any name)

Empty inputs are not allowed. Based on the input given by the user, the script should create and run the advisor command.

Allowed values for gpu name: xehpg_256xve, xehpg_512xve, gen12_tgl, gen12_tg1, gen11_icl, gen9_gt2, gen9_gt3, gen9_gt4
If the user inputs any other value, it should prompt again to input

- Open the generated report using firefox browser, Give the option to load available modules 
- Give the option to compile the program in the same script (based on the program file using gcc or g++)
