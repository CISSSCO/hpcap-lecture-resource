* Introduction to MPI (Message Passing Interface)
* What is MPI?
MPI stands for Message Passing Interface. It is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a variety of parallel computing architectures. MPI is widely used for developing parallel applications and is essential for high-performance computing (HPC).
* History and Development of MPI
MPI was developed in the early 1990s by the MPI Forum, a group consisting of parallel computing vendors, library writers, and application specialists. The need for a standard messaging protocol arose due to the growing diversity of parallel computing environments. Before MPI, parallel programming was fragmented with various proprietary and non-standard systems. MPI was established to provide a unified and efficient way to develop parallel programs.
* Why MPI?
- **Portability**: MPI is designed to run on various systems, from small clusters to large supercomputers.
- **Performance**: Optimized for high performance on different hardware architectures.
- **Scalability**: Supports efficient communication for large-scale systems.
- **Flexibility**: Offers a wide range of communication operations and can be used in different parallel programming models.
* MPI Implementations
There are several implementations of MPI, some of the most popular ones include:
- **MPICH**: A high-performance and widely portable implementation of MPI.
- **Open MPI**: An open-source MPI implementation that combines technologies and resources from several projects.
- **MVAPICH**: MPI over InfiniBand, optimized for high performance on InfiniBand clusters.
* Shared vs Distributed Systems
- **Shared Memory Systems**: Multiple processors access a common memory space. Communication between processors is implicit and achieved through memory read/write operations.
- **Distributed Memory Systems**: Each processor has its own private memory. Communication between processors is explicit and typically achieved through message passing, which is where MPI comes into play.
* Downloading and Installing MPI
To get started with MPI, you need to download and install an MPI implementation. Here are general steps for downloading and installing Open MPI:
1. **Download Open MPI**:
   Visit the [Open MPI website](https://www.open-mpi.org) and download the latest version of Open MPI.
2. **Extract the tarball**:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   tar -xvf openmpi-x.y.z.tar.gz
   cd openmpi-x.y.z
   #+END_SRC
3. **Configure, Build, and Install**:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
   make
   make install
   #+END_SRC
4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   export PATH=/path/to/install/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   #+END_SRC
* Loading MPI on PARAM shavak
#+begin_src bash
source /home/apps/spack/share/spack/setup.env.sh # source spack package manager
spack find openmpi  # check if mpi is installed or not
# spack install -j40 openmpi   # if not installed then this command will install the latest version of openmpi
spack load openmpi/_your_hash   # load mpi with specific has if multiple version is installed
#+end_src
